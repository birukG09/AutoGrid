# AutoGrid - Distributed Energy Controller

## Overview

AutoGrid is a multi-language distributed microgrid energy management system that provides real-time monitoring, optimization, and control of distributed energy resources. The system coordinates solar panels, wind turbines, battery storage, and electric vehicle charging using a sophisticated multi-layer architecture. Built with a console-based interface featuring green/white/red engineering/cyber theming, the application offers real-time control, predictive analytics, Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) operations, and distributed consensus protocols for microgrid operators.
